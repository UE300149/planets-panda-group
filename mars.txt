I am all for a base on mars. It has two moons, so we could at least pretend that we are on Tatooine.
Hm I'm not sure about that. Mars has a lot of sand. I dont't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating. And it gets everwhere.
I like both of your arguments. Apparently Mars has vulcanos. Should we be worried about that?
