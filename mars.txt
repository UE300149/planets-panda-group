I am all for a base on Mars. It has two moons, so we could at least pretend that we are on Tatooine.
Hm, I'm not sure about that. Mars has a lot of sand. I dont't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating. And it gets everywhere.
Apparently Mars has vulcanos. Should we be worried about that?
I'm wondering the same... but hopefully they're not erupting anymore
Yes I think you´re right and they won´t erupt anymore. If we build a dome on mars we could keep the sand out.
